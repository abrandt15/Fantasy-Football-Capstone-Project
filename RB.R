## remove unwanted columns

## Plots to Understand

ggplot(rb, aes(x=1, y = RushingAttempts)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(rb, aes(x = RushingAttempts, y = RushingYards)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = Name)) 
  #geom_label_repel(aes(label = Name))

ggplot(rb, aes(x = ReceivingTargets, y = ReceivingYards)) +
  #geom_point()
geom_label(aes(label = Name)) 

ggplot(rb, aes(x = ReceivingTargets, y = ReceivingYards)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Name))


cor(rb$RushingAttempts, rb$RushingYards, method="spearman")
cor(rb$ReceivingTargets, rb$ReceivingYards, method="spearman")

## Linear Models

rb_lm <- lm(FantasyPointsPPR ~ RushingYards, data = rb)
rb_lm
rb_lm_2 <- lm(FantasyPointsPPR ~ ReceivingYards, data = rb)
